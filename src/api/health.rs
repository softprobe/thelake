/// reachability are enforced when connections attach (startup and rebuild),
/// and scanning cold DuckLake tables here would make readiness flap on slow
/// storage rather than on actual brokenness.
///
/// Known limit: dispatch is round-robin, so one call samples ONE worker. This
/// cannot report "pool partially degraded" -- and because the probe heals the
/// worker it lands on, it will rarely report unready for a healable pool. That
/// is the intended division of labour: self-heal fixes poisoned workers, and
/// readiness only sheds traffic when the engine cannot be built or reached at
/// all (which fails on any worker).
///
/// The first probe also constructs the default tenant engine (extensions,
/// catalog attach), which is legitimate readiness work and can take seconds.
/// Two consequences: the probe runs in a spawned task so a dropped probe
/// connection (k8s timing out its attempt) cannot discard construction
/// progress -- the engine still lands in the manager's cache for the next
/// attempt -- and the in-handler budget is generous; the k8s probe's own
/// `timeoutSeconds` bounds each attempt.
